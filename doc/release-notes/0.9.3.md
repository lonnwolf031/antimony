Antimony 0.9.3
--------------

## Features
- Use alt modifier to drag values faster
- Add 'Show math string' node
- Pre-emptively clip rendering to screen size (which should make rendering faster when zoomed in)
- Easier packaging for Debian (thanks @pfelecan)
- Flatter icon (thanks, @ApostolosB)

## Bugfixes:
- Tab and shift-tab now switch between datums like they used to (before 0.9.1)
- HSB color node is no longer black by default
- Fix extra images being drawn on load
- 'Hide UI' menu item actually does what it says
