Antimony 0.9.2
--------------

This release has relatively few user-facing features, but should make the
lives of our Linux packaging volunteers easier.

There are also a host of bugfixes in `sb.ui` (which contains a set of
immediate-mode UI calls that can be placed in `Node` scripts).

## Features
- Building now uses `cmake` instead of `qmake`, which is much simpler
- `sb.ui` functions now take an optional `key` argument to disambiguate

### Bugfixes:
- Dragging `sb.ui` shapes was not undoable; now, it is.
- Correct positions are passed into controls with absolute drag callbacks
- Fixed a bug where you could end up with unparented control instances
